## Mechanical and Manufacturing - Part drawings and Assembly Drawings

When it comes to manufacturing and machine design, you need accurate, readable part drawings and/or assembly drawings so that contractors and manufacturers can bring your projects to life. We consult with our clients to ensure they receive designs that meets their specific business, industrial or commercial requirements. Drawing on diligent Research & Development practices, we use AutoCAD software to develop prototype, patent drawings, and complex part and assembly drawings. Examples of various applications include:

 - Plastic injection mouldings (consumer products and commercial solutions)
 - Customized industrial innovations and supplies (e.g. customized commercial vehicle or industrial facility add-ons)  
 - Aerospace designs for modifying aircrafts and helicopters 
 - Sheet metal fabrication
