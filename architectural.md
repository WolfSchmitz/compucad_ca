## Architectural drawings, 3D modeling and virtual walk-throughs 

Sometimes a blueprint just isn’t enough to visualize a new space. Turn your 2D blueprint into a 3D model and virtually “walk through” your new space with CompuCAD’s 3D modeling and virtual walk-throughs.   

Additionally, we’ve worked with builders to develop drawings for customized client requests of up to 600 square meters in architecture. We develop blue prints, permit drawings and working plans for municipal approval. 

Typical projects include:
 - Residential add-ons (e.g. decks, sun rooms, etc.) 
 - Mixed use building add-ons 
 - 3D modeling and virtual walk-throughs
